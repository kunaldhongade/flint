### Market Feasibility: **8/10**

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Problem Statement** ✅
   - Yield fragmentation: Real problem
   - Risk opacity: Valid concern
   - Institutional trust gap: Well-documented need

   - Regulatory pressure increasing (MiCA, etc.)
   - Institutional DeFi adoption accelerating

3. **Competitive Positioning** ✅
   - Not competing with Flare Finance (complementary)
   - Enhances earnXRP (partnership opportunity)
   - Unique AI Trust Layer differentiator

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ $10M TVL Year 1 target might be optimistic (Flare TVL currently ~$10M total)
- ⚠️ 100 paying users Year 1 requires strong marketing
- ⚠️ Institutional adoption takes longer than retail

### Financial Feasibility: **8/10**

**Strengths:**
1. **Reasonable Budget** ✅
   - $70K for 6-month MVP is realistic
   - Team size (3-4 people) is appropriate
   - Budget breakdown is detailed and sensible

2. **Revenue Model** ✅
   - Multiple revenue streams (diversified)
   - Standard DeFi fee structure (proven model)
   - Clear path to profitability

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Year 1 loss of $50K assumes you can raise $70K + cover losses
- ⚠️ Premium tier ($5K/month) might be hard to sell initially
- ⚠️ Performance fees depend on actual profits (uncertain)
