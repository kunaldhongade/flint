    """
    Loads and parses a contract ABI JSON file from package resources.

    The result is cached to improve performance on subsequent calls with the
    same abi_name.

    Args:
        abi_name: The base name of the ABI file (without .json extension)
                  located in the 'flare_ai_kit/abis' resources directory.

    Returns:
        The parsed ABI structure, typically a list of dictionaries.

    Raises:
        AbiError: If the ABI file is not found, cannot be parsed, is not in the
                  expected list format, or other loading errors occur.
